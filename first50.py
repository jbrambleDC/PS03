# Small program to display the first 50 lines of a web log (chronically)
# Creates a single mapper that maps every line to the same key, with the values
# being the datetime and the original weblog line.
# The reducer counts 50

# The one problem with this approach is that all of the keys need to go through the same reducer.
# We can do it better with a distributed first50.
